## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Cellular Sleep Voyage project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on making science education accessible to young learners.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- **Constructive Feedback**: Providing helpful, specific feedback that helps others improve
- **Scientific Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and citing sources for scientific claims
- **Collaborative Spirit**: Working together toward the shared goal of accessible science education
- **Patience with Learning**: Supporting contributors at all skill levels
- **Recognition of Contributions**: Acknowledging the work and ideas of others
- **Child Safety Awareness**: Prioritizing the safety and well-being of our young audience

### Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

## Educational Project Considerations

Given that this project creates educational content for children, we have additional standards:

### Content Standards
- **Age Appropriateness**: All content must be suitable for 10-year-old learners
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Information must be based on peer-reviewed research
- **Educational Value**: Contributions should enhance learning outcomes
- **Safety First**: No content that could be harmful to children's physical or mental well-being

### Community Interaction
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain a tone appropriate for an educational environment
- **Inclusive Language**: Use language that welcomes learners from all backgrounds
- **Constructive Criticism**: Focus feedback on content and ideas, not individuals
- **Mentorship Mindset**: Help newer contributors learn and grow

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Process

### Reporting
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [conduct@cellularsleepvoyage.org]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

When reporting, please include:
- **Description of the incident**: What happened?
- **When and where**: Time and location (online platform, etc.)
- **Who was involved**: People involved (you can report anonymously)
- **Impact**: How did this affect you or the community?
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, links, or other documentation if available

### Investigation
All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. The investigation process includes:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will review the incident and gather additional information if needed
3. **Decision**: We will determine appropriate action based on our guidelines
4. **Communication**: We will communicate our decision to relevant parties
5. **Follow-up**: We will check in to ensure the issue has been resolved

### Consequences

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

Consequences for violations may include:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Educational Mission Alignment

All enforcement actions will consider our primary mission: creating high-quality, scientifically accurate educational content for children. Actions that support this mission are encouraged, while those that detract from it will be addressed promptly.

### Special Considerations for Educational Content
- **Child Safety**: Any content or behavior that could harm children will result in immediate action
- **Scientific Integrity**: Persistent sharing of misinformation may result in removal from the project
- **Educational Quality**: Contributions that consistently lower educational quality may be restricted

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly treated, you may appeal enforcement decisions by:

1. **Contacting Leadership**: Email [appeals@cellularsleepvoyage.org] within 30 days
2. **Providing Context**: Explain why you believe the decision was unfair
3. **Review Process**: A different maintainer will review your case
4. **Final Decision**: Appeals decisions are final

## Positive Community Building

We encourage all community members to:

### Foster Learning
- **Share Knowledge**: Help others learn about science, programming, or education
- **Ask Questions**: Create an environment where questions are welcomed
- **Provide Resources**: Share helpful links, papers, or educational materials
- **Celebrate Discoveries**: Acknowledge when someone learns something new
