# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cellular Sleep Voyage is an interactive web-based educational experience that takes 10-year-old STEM enthusiasts on a "Fantastic Voyage" style journey through a living cell to discover the mitochondrial origins of sleep pressure. Combining cutting-edge 2025 sleep science with engaging sci-fi storytelling, the product transforms complex cellular biology into an adventure where students pilot a microscopic vessel through cellular cities, witnessing firsthand how overworked mitochondrial power plants create toxic sparks that signal the need for sleep.

The experience bridges Matthew Walker's sleep science with revolutionary mitochondrial research, using familiar analogies (cellular cities, power plants, assembly lines) while maintaining scientific accuracy. Students progress through increasingly complex levels of understanding, from basic cellular exploration to managing sleep-wake cycles in their virtual laboratory specimens.
